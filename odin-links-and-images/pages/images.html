    <h1>Image Formats</h1>
    <p>This page features different types of image formats</p>

    <h2>JPGs</h2>
    <p>JPG images are good for photos, since they're good at depicting color, but cannot depict transparent pixels</p>

    <h2>GIFs</h2>
    <p>GIFs are great for animation, however they can't depict color as effectively as JPGs</p>

    <h2>PNGs</h2>
    <p>PNGs are great for diagrams and icons, since they deal with color palettes and opacity just fine, but lack in
        file size optimization</p>

    <h2>SVGs</h2>
    <p>SVGs are amazing. They can display images without any loss of quality on scaling. Use them wherever you can.</p>
